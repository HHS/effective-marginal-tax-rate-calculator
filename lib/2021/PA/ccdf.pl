		#Families on TANF receive a child care allowance equivalent to the amount they would receive through CCDF, just covered by different funding. But they do not need to satisfy minimum work hour requirements. Presumably this was originally conceived as a policy because CCDF minimum work hours coincided with TANF work hours.
		#There are also exemptions for adults with disabilities. One is time-sensitive and is only works for half the year (a parent receivng CCDF and becoming disabled enough that they cannot work, after initial determination, is eligible for CCDF for up to 183 days), and the other is that in a two-parent/caretaker family, eligibility can be achieved is one parent has a disabiltiy such that they cannot care for the child. There are also special requirements for Head Start, but since we are primarily determining eligibitliy for parents who are already in CCDF (and maybe Head Start as well), we'll leave this out for now.
		#work hour requirements are waived for high school students younger than 22.
		#Families formerly receiving TANF benefits can also receive CCDF for up to 183 days.
		#  STEP 2: DETERMINE FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY FOR CCDF SUBSIDIES		#
		# Note: although Social Security income is included in income tabulations, child SSI is explicitly exempted, but adult SSI is not. We are only including adult SSI in the 2020 FRS and 2021 MTRC. 
		
		# While in NH, had decided upon looking at manual that all adults in family should have income counted and can take care of the child. Actually based on relation of adults to children in hh, but we are refraining from asking specific relationship questions.

		$ccdf_poverty_percent = $ccdf_income / $in->{'fpl'};
		# Page 43  of the child care subsidy manual clarifies exit eligibility income requirements. 

		#gift income note: We are only including recurring gift income in this MTRC tool (for now), and upon further clarification from Allegheny County, the exemption on gifts only applies to lump sum gifts. This would be the perl code snippet if including that exemption: pos_sub($out->{'gift_income'}, $lump_sum_exemption) 
		# One possible policy option for either reducing co-pays or qualifying for child care subsidies might be to use policy triggers to incentivize businesses to offer dependent care flexible spending accounts to their employees, which allow employees to deposit pre-tax earnings into an account dedicated to paying for costs such as child care. Having access to an account like this would seem to allow employee earnings to fall below income eligibility thresholds for a number of programs (e.g. CCDF, SNAP, and TANF), which would be helpful  if cash or near-cash benefits from those programs increase net resources by more than the amount that families might lose by no longer qualifying for the child and dependent care tax credit, which I think would no longer be available if enrolled in a dependent care FSA. For all these benefit programs, we'd also have to check whether funds in a dependent care FSA count as assets (or if assets that spent in the same month they are received are not actually assets).

So it's clear that the manual is out of date, and that the 2021 numbers should be used.
