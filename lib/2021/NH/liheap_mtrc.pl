#	eap 			#This is NH's Electric Assistance Program (EAP), which provides a reduction in the energy bill of houses that rely on electric heat. It needs to be processed first, since it represents the customer responsibility for the energy bill. LIHEAP comes after and has benefits that are lower for electric heating customers because they already have access to this other benefit.

This is the maximum that NH's LIHEAP income limit could be, but it is not invoked in current policy because the current NH income limit is below this amount. These limits are based on a baseline four-person household multiplied by percentages, as detailed here: https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/96.85.

	#We calculate LIHEAP and EAP benefits below, and also calculate energy costs.
		  
	# 1. We first see if the individual is assigned FAP or EAP eligbility:

	#Beginning in 2021 -- with the MTRC -- we are separating heating and energy as utilities separate from rent.
	#IMPORTANT NOTE: ALTHOUGH WE INCORPORATE USER-ENTERED VALUES BELOW BY ADDING THE ESTIMATED BENEFIT AMOUNT TO THE STATED ENERGY EXPENSES PEOPLE FACE, AT LEAST IN NH WE ARE NOT AT THIS TIME ABLE TO INCORPORATE THOSE COSTS IN CALCULATING THE VALUE OF THE LIHEAP BENEFIT, SINCE THE BENEFIT ITSELF IS PARTIALLY BASED ON TOTAL ENERGY COSTS. SO UNLESS WE ASK FOR HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE PAYING ALONG WITH HOW MUCH THE TOTAL COSTS OF ENERGY ARE, WE WILL BE MISSING AT LEAST ONE VARIABLE NEEDED FOR THE BELOW CALCULATIONS. AS A PROXY, WE ARE USING THE PHA ALLOWANCES BASED ON DIFFERENT HEATING COSTS TO ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF A BENEFIT, AND THEN MAKING A SIMILAR CALCULATION THAT WE DO FOR OTHER PROGRAMS THAT SUBSIDIZE EXPENSES.

		# NH has two energy assistance programs for low-income individuals: the Fuel Assistance Program (FAP), which is the more general LIHEAP program, and the Electric Assistance Program (EAP), specific to electric heat consumers. 
		#
		# Both programs are designed to reduce the energy bills of people who are responsibile for their own energy bills. People with subsidized housing are eligible for benefits if they meet all other FAP requirements for eligibility, if they are responsible for paying own heating bill, and if they have annual heating costs of at least $100. We proxy total utility costs as heat costs here to meet this threshold. Those with utilities included in the rent and aren't responsible for paying own heating bill are not eligible for FAP benefits. 
		
		# 2. Calculating gross income according to LIHEAP rules.
		#
		# Since both programs are operated by the same agency and the EAP program does not appear to publish a clear indication of what counts as "gross income," we can assume they count different types of income the same way. Also the FY 2020 LIHEAP state plan indicates "The CAAs will also take an Electric Assistance Program (EAP) application in coordination with FAP and WAP as EAP uses mostly the same eligibility requirements, although it is a separate application." LIHEAP has a very specific accounting of what counts as income.

		# Organizing non-disregarded income:
		$liheap_static_unearned_income = $in->{'unearn_gross_mon_inc_amt_ag'}; #For a very advanced tool, we could go through these one by one and see if there are any differences between what's counted as underaned income for LIHEAP compared to unearned income for other programs, but any differences seem nominal or rare based on our reading.

		# The first $50 of interest and dividents is disregarded.

			#We now subtract this from the local rent_paid variable.
			
		}
				

		# 5. DETERMINE LIHEAP ELIGIBILITY AND BENEFITS:
		#
		# LIHEAP applies to all energy types. 
		#
		# In the absence of Attachment C-1, which allows LIHEAP applicants to add the electric costs of operating their heating source,  we will defer to the PHA utility allowances for energy costs for users not entering teheir costs.

While we could consider this a near-cash resource, since energy is a constant need, we are not doing that here because LIHEAP is paid to energy companies and pay for considerably fewer goods than SNAP dollars can.
