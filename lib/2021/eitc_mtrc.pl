Under "normal years," the IRS releases statements with all these figures and updates, but the additional calculations are detailed below because the IRS has not released a similar guidance as they have for previous annual updates to EITC and other tax figures. Hence, the lengthy explanations for the numbers derived below.

"In the case of a joint return filed by an eligible individual and such individual's spouse, the phaseout amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be increased by $5,000." The previous IRS adjustment for 2021 indicated that the $5,000 indicated in the original law, adjusted for inflation, is $5,940 (the difference between $14,820 and $8,880. So that's $17,550, a number confirmed by CRS and other reports. CRS indicates this plateau's end is $11,610 for single filers, $17,550 for married ones.

Using the variable designations (and $eitc_recd for the amount of EITC received, and $eitc_income_limit for these thresholds, this translates to 
						# $eitc_recd = ($eitc_phasein_rate) * ($eitc_plateau_start) - ($eitc_phaseout_rate)*($eitc_income_limit - $eitc_plateau_end).
						# When setting $eitc_recd to 0, the two numbers emerging from this equality for $eitc_income_limit are $21,427 and $27,367. These are not widely discussed figures but are reflected in charts in the CRS document and other documents related to the ARPA changes.
