This limits the impact of benefit cliffs on these families, but benefit cliffs will still exist if income does not increase and unsubsidized child care exceeds subsidized rates.

		# One possible policy option for either reducing co-pays or qualifying for child care subsidies might be to use policy triggers to incentivize businesses to offer dependent care flexible spending accounts to their employees, which allow employees to deposit pre-tax earnings into an account dedicated to paying for costs such as child care. Having access to an account like this would seem to allow employee earnings to fall below income eligibility thresholds for a number of programs (e.g. CCDF, SNAP, and TANF), which would be helpful  if cash or near-cash benefits from those programs increase net resources by more than the amount that families might lose by no longer qualifying for the child and dependent care tax credit, which I think would no longer be available if enrolled in a dependent care FSA. For all these benefit programs, we'd also have to check whether funds in a dependent care FSA count as assets (or if assets that spent in the same month they are received are not actually assets).

Alternatively, we could include a proportional markup  against the full cost of care (fullcost_all_children), with any increases in child care schedules that might demand higher rates, but the market rate study includes rates that already have a large enough jump betweeen part-time and full-time care (that this tool dampens to something more realistic by including a half-time rate), that making the markup proportional to the market rate of care would exacerbate marginal tax rates unrealistically -- for the amounts it would raise child care rates by, users would most likely simply switch providers. This could be changed easily in the code if desired.
