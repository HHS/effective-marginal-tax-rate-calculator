					# At this point, we will know whether any of the parents in the household have been on sanctions, and if they have, whether they still qualify for sanctions. Below is the formulas needed to reduce TANF benefits when one or more parent is on sanctions, which become progressively more punitive the longer a parent does not satisfy work requirements. Conceivably, we could use parent variables sanctionlevel_parent# to determine the reductions in TANF benefits as a result. For now, since we are not incorporating work requirements in ME, we are setting the TANF amount to 0 in this case, but this is where sanctions could be included to lower TANF receipt.

Keeping this in here because we may want to reconsider the time horizon of this approach elsewhere.

			$tanf_sanctioned_amt = 0; #May need to change this for Maine. As above, we are not modeling a separate, long-term sanction amount over the course of a year. The maximum length of time that a family in ME can be on TANF and be on sanctions appears to be a few months, so the value of modeling the addition of some TANF for some family members during that time, while also using the sanctioned amount to reduce SNAP benefits accordingly (since SNAP income includes the amount of TANF cash assistance that has been sanctioned), does not seem to add substantially to the MTRC tool. It seems better to present that if a family is currently receiving TANF but is either not satisfying work requirements now or not planning on satisfying work requirements in the future, that we do not reflect the TANF cash assistance, reduced by TANF, that they could receive if not meeting work requirements. In terms of sustainabiltiy of family finances, it also seems prudent to indicate that they cannot rely on TANF as a source of cash assistance if they are not exempt from work requirements.
