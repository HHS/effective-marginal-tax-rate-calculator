	#Maine's LIHEAP program consists of Heating Assistance (HEAP), Cooling Assistance, and Weatherization Assitance. This code focuses solely on the Heating Assistance portion of the LIHEAP program. To match the coding in other states, we are using the generic "LIHEAP" name below, but users will see the state name ("Home Energy Assistance Program" or "HEAP") when using the online tool.

The criteria for the consumption-based method largely mirror the assumptions of the MTRC model, so we will be using the dollars for each point derived from that method.
