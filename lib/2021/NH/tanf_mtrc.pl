					# It appears that NH does not have separate two-parent work requirement standards, in contrast to other states that follow federal minimums. NH does, however, include a fairly broad array of activities that could be undertaken to satisfy job requirements, including job search activitities. "Job search" or other similarly vague-sounding activities cannot, however, lead toward satisfaction of work requirements without being part of a TANF recipient's Employability Plan (EP), which is determined at intake and presumably regularly reviewed throughout participation. We can therefore assume that people who are on sanctions are not satisfying their EP. Given this framework, it seems possible that someone may not be satisfying their work requirements not because of lower than required hours, but that they are not engaged in the activities detailed in their EP, even if they are working enough hours to satisfy work requirements. It seems plausible, however, that if an individual is both sanctioned and working below the work rquirement working hours, that gaining enough employment hours to satisfy the work requirements would allow an individual to at least temporarily be removed from sanctions.

					# At this point, we will know whether any of the parents in the household have been on sanctions, and if they have, whether they still qualify for sanctions. Below is the formulas needed to reduce TANF benefits when one or more parent is on sanctions, which become progressively more punitive the longer a parent does not satisfy work requirements. Conceivably, we could use parent variables sanctionlevel_parent# to determine the reductions in TANF benefits as a result. It would be possible to impute some approximation of those based on how much cash asssistance we calculate a family should be eligible for based on what they receive and how many parents are on sanctions. However, this imputation would not support a yearly impact of sanctions, as "after 4 weeks of continued noncompliance without good cause at LEVEL 3, [the policy is to ] terminate financial assistance for all members of the assistance group." This means that after 10 weeks of not satisfying work requirements, the family will get kicked off of FANF and NHEP. Because being sanctioned for any length longer than 4 weeks is therefore not a permanent financial picture (we cannot "model" that existence over the course of a year), we can, for the purposes of this model, simply assume that this family will not be getting these benefits as long as anyone in the assistance group will not receive TANF benefits.

The maximum length of time that a family in NH can be on TANF and be on sanctions appears to be 10 weeks, so the value of modeling the addition of some TANF for some family members during that time, while also using the sanctioned amount to reduce SNAP benefits accordingly (since SNAP income includes the amount of TANF cash assistance that has been sanctioned), does not seem to add substantially to the MTRC tool. It seems better to present that if a family is currently receiving TANF but is either not satisfying work requirements now or not planning on satisfying work requirements in the future, that we do not reflect the TANF cash assistance, reduced by TANF, that they could receive if not meeting work requirements. In terms of sustainabiltiy of family finances, it also seems prudent to indicate that they cannot rely on TANF as a source of cash assistance if they are not exempt from work requirements.
