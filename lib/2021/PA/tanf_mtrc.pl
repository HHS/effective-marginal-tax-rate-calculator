Given this framework, it seems possible that someone may not be satisfying their work requirements not because of lower than required hours, but that they are not engaged in the activities detailed in their EP, even if they are working enough hours to satisfy work requirements. It seems plausible, however, that if an individual is both sanctioned and working below the work rquirement working hours, that gaining enough employment hours to satisfy the work requirements would allow an individual to at least temporarily be removed from sanctions.

	#A note about TANF transportation subsidies:
	#PA, as I believe other states, allows for transportation reimbursement for job-seeking activities, training, and some job retention activities. Conceivably, the trasnportation module could be moved to after the tanf module (or possibly re-run after TANF) to reduce transportation costs by these reimbursements. (In PA, the program that does this is called SPAL, for "sepcial allowances.") However, we are not doing this for Pennsylvania, because we are removing all work requirements from it (at least for Allegheny County), and the state's TANF program provides transportation reimbursement only up to the date that a first paycheck is received. Thus the program does not cover recurring transportatin costs to and from work, and while it would cover transportation to and from training, we are removing the questions about training and work requirements from the Allegheny County MTRC. But transportation reimbursements should still be considered for other states, and potentially for adaptation into any other tools or if Pennsylvania administrators of this tool eventually decide to put transportation subsidies into the code. (E.g. while Allegheny County may have a waiver for work requirements, other places that attempt to integrate this tool might not.)
	# Transportation allowances in TANF are described in Section 135.6 of the PA Cash Assistance Handbook. (http://services.dpw.state.pa.us/oimpolicymanuals/cash/135_Employment_and_Training_Requirements/135_6_Special_Allowances_for_Supportive_Services.htm as of 6/14/21).
